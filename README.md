# Group 6 - MONKEyCAR

### What you are going to make?

Our goal is to make a web-based application similar to Scratch that teaches children how to code. However, unlike Scratch, MONKEyCAR (the name of our application) will work with the real smart-car, which will perform the actions that the child “programmed” in our app, such as "Move 10 steps forward".  

### Why will you make it?

Ultimately, our hopes in making this program was to be able to teach, and inspire kids to code in a more fun and interactive way!

### What problem does it solve?

Technology is being integrated more and more into our day to day lives, with a larger number of people wanting to learn programming. However, for young children, programming might be a bit intimidating at first, and our goal is to create a user-friendly, supportive platform that will help guide them.

### How you are going to make it?

We had a lot of different options on how to implement this idea, such as:
- Code blocks that you can put together and can be executed at the same time
- Different game modes depending on difficulty
- Buttons that are written like code that you can just press
- Storing different profiles (maybe with completion points, command history, favourite programmes, ..)
- Providing some challenges (like specific actions to do with code, code with blank spaces, change code to do something different, etc)
- Leaderboards for the challenges to encourage more coding
- Using the emulator within the web page to test the code or to use the app even if the car is not available
- Adding some sounds so that the car could make cars depending on certain conditions
- Using the sensors by making sure no obstacles are hit

However, this is what we _finally_ envisioned MONKEyCAR to look like:

### What kind of technology are we going to use?
We will be primarily using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** in order to develop our website, and then use **C++** for the translated car movements.
