What you are going to make?

We basically want to do a version of Scratch that teaches code to children, but unlike Scratch works with a real car/emulator which performs the actions that the child “programmed” in an app. 

Why will you make it?

To teach children to code in a really fun and interactive way.

What problem does it solve?

Technology is being integrated more and more into our day to day lives, with a larger number of people wanting to learn programming. However, for young children, programming might be a bit intimidating at first, and our goal is to create a user-friendly, supportive platform that will help guide them.

How you are going to make it?

We have a few options on how to implement this idea:
- Different game modes depending on difficulty
- Buttons that are written like code that you can just press
- Code blocks that you can put together and can be executed at the same time
- Fill in blank spaces in code
- Store different profiles (maybe with completion points, command history, favourite programmes, ..)
- Provide some challenges (like specific actions to do with code, code with blank spaces, change code to do something different, etc)
- Adding some sound
- Using the sensors by making sure no obstacles are hit
- Using the emulator to test the code or to use the app even if the car is not available
- Leaderboard or something to add some competition

What kind of technology you are going to use?
C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
